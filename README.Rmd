soothsayer tries to automate time series model selection, using a flexible approach to 
fitting your own version of Feature-based Forecast Model Selection (FFORMS) (which is a really hard to remember acronym). 
The package does this in a way that tries to leverage the **tidy** framework.

In other words, it powers a simple, but flexible workflow: 

* compute time series features (e.g. Box-Pierce statistic, time series entropy, ...)
* compute forecasts across many series using the awesome **fable/fabletools** packages
* generate a model (**oracle**) which maps between the features of a time series, and the model errors

It also supports model selection via simple decision rules (e.g. "time series length greater than 30 >> fit an ETS, otherwise fit an AR model"). These are implemented to enable simpler workflows. They are also intended to enable benchmarking for simple, rule based method selection proposals.  

Finally, the package (and everything in it) is intended to work within the **fable/fabletools/tidyverts** framework - 
the generated models are meant to be plug-able into the model/forecast/generate/... functions of **fabletools** seamlessly. 

Finally, we hope to provide a way to ensemble methods, using weights generated by oracles.
